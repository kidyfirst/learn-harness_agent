"""LLM tool functions for the memory system.

These are registered as agent tools at construction time. They use
``langchain_core.tools.tool`` to produce ``StructuredTool`` instances.

The agent exposes read-only service-backed tools:

* ``memory_search(query, max_results)`` routes through the
  :class:`MemoryService` ranker (atom + page + raw).
* ``memory_get(path, start, lines)`` resolves a virtual path returned by
  ``memory_search``.

Durable writes are not exposed as a tool. The agent persists user-visible
memory by editing the workspace markdown files (USER.md / MEMORY.md /
AGENTS.md). Structured AtomCards are produced asynchronously by the idle
distillation pipeline from the captured raw conversation, not by the LLM
directly.

Each tool wraps the underlying service call in a broad ``except`` so that
storage / DB faults degrade into a human-readable string instead of
crashing the agent turn or leaking a stack trace into the conversation.
